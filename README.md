hdhomerun-vlc
=============

Simple Bash script to tune my HD Homerun to a station of my choice, and open the stream in VLC.

Requires the hdhomerun_config binary on your path.
Requires VLC is installed.
Only used/tested on OS X.

Currently contains my channel map hard-coded.  I may or may not ever improve on this.  This script was written to make my life a little easier.
